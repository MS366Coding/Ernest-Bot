# Ernest-Bot
A Discord Bot made with just Python!

I made this bot a few months ago. I created this bot on www.Repl.it and hosted it for free using www.uptimerobot.com.
I am also including a keep_alive.py file which has a basic Flask so as to easily host the bot online.

There are some issues in its mute and tempmute functions. I am looking forward to suggestions.
